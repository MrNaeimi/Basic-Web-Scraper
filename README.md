Basic Web Scraper (Python)
This project demonstrates a fundamental web scraping script written in Python. It's designed to extract specific data (e.g., quotes and authors) from publicly available websites for purposes like data collection or simple content aggregation. This particular script is tailored to scrape quotes from http://quotes.toscrape.com/.

Key Features
HTTP Requests: Fetches web page content using the requests library.

HTML Parsing: Parses HTML content to navigate the Document Object Model (DOM) and extract targeted data using BeautifulSoup4.

Error Handling: Includes basic error handling for network issues or invalid URLs during the fetching process.

Modular Design: Organized into a clear function (scrape_quotes) for reusability and readability.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: requests, BeautifulSoup4

How to Run Locally
Follow these steps to set up and run the web scraper on your local machine:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Basic-Web-Scraper-Python.git
cd Basic-Web-Scraper-Python

(Replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your GitHub username)

Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the script:

python3 scraper.py

The extracted data (quotes and authors) will be printed directly to your terminal.

Development Insights & Learning
This project provided hands-on experience with:

HTTP Communication: Understanding how Python interacts with web servers to retrieve content.

HTML Parsing: Gaining proficiency in navigating and extracting specific data from HTML structures using CSS selectors.

Library Usage: Practical application of requests for making web requests and BeautifulSoup4 for efficient data extraction.

Error Handling: Implementing basic error management for robust script execution.

Collaborative Development: This project's structure and initial guidance were developed with assistance from Google's Gemini Large Language Model. Gemini provided the foundational code structure and best practices for web scraping. My role focused on adapting the script to specific data extraction needs, refining the parsing logic, and ensuring overall functionality.

Future Enhancements
Implement more sophisticated error handling (e.g., handling CAPTCHAs, IP blocking, rate limiting).

Add data storage capabilities (e.g., saving extracted data to CSV, JSON files, or a database).

Integrate with scheduling tools for automated and periodic scraping.

Develop a more generic framework to allow users to input URLs and selectors.
